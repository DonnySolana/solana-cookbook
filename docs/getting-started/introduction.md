# Why Cook Book?

The Solana Cookbook contains recipes that will take you from no how to oh yea. Each recipe is designed to focus on a specific aspect of clients and or program for the Solana Blockchain. The Cookbook is an on going effort to share development implementations, best practices, and help provide you with the knowldge & resources needed to become a great chef! Get ready to cook and serve up the best programs and applications in the Solana ecosystem.

The format here is is less talk, less doc, and more walk. This is for builders and doers. Simple digestable pieces. Everything you need to build. Everything is on the menu. As much as you can digest. If you want to read, and like deep dives (I do..) we have all the links to documentation and resources you need. Something missing? Contribute.

::: tip
*No matter your background, if you follow the recipes and guides contained within, and utilize the available resources, you will succeed. You will be building Solana clients and programs in no time. If we can do it, so can you.   -Chefs*

## Chefs Overview

Solana programs (smart contracts) are deployed to the Solana blockchain. You interact with these programs using clients (web3, cli, SDK), generally using a wallet. Wallets are associated with a users account address and used to sign and authorize transactions (with a keypair). Wallets are used to track a users balance, tokens, NFTs, and to interact with the entire Solana eco system. On Solana, the native token 'SOL' is referenced by programs and some clients in lamports (the micro units used to pay for fees and rent). Anyone can deploy a program to the Solana blockchain, and anyone can write a client in web3 or one of the many SDKs made available one your favorite language. The Solana blockchain is run by clusters of Nodes or Validators that is run by thousands of distributed operators all over the world, and anyone can participate. Built and maintained by Solana Labs, Solana Blockchain provides the ecosystem and the world an open platform to create, develop, distribute, and connect everything and everyone. When you share we all benefit. WAGMI.
