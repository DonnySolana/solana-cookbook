# Clients: Web3 and beyond

#### Takeout
- Clients interact with Solana via JSON RPC API Endpoints
- Clients submits transactions to a Cluster via these JSON RPC API Endpoints
- The Solana runtime will execute a program to process the instructions in a transactions
- Solana maintains several end points to Clusters including devnet, testnet, and mainnet
- Client SDKs are provided by Solana including web3, json rpc, CLI, and rust.
- Many 3rd Parties SDKs are available including c#, python, go, java, swift, and

#### Delivery
Clients (or dapps) interact with the Solana blockchain via JSON RPC API, defining an endpoint (e.g. https://api.devnet.solana.com), and sending transactions to programs. The 'endpoint' (Url) called by the client points to a Solana Cluster. A cluster is a set of validators working together to serve client transactions and maintain the transactions in the ledger. Solana maintains dedicated api nodes to fulfill JSON-RPC requests for each public cluster, and third parties may as well. Currently Solana maintains Devnet, Testnet, and Mainnetbeta. Websockets are also available to subscribe to realtime updates. 

Solana Labs has created an easy to use [Web3 SDK](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/)), as well as a JSON RPC API, CLI tools, a Rust API, and much more. There are also a host of other Solana tools and 3rd party SDKs ready to help you start building and integrate Solana blockchain and payments into your existing games and applications.

These SDKs give you the power to build fully functional dApps on Solana in your favorite languages! What is provided also includes even more tools to help you integrate Solana with your new and existing applications as well as programs in the Soalana ecosystem! Do you have tools and platforms to build and distribute NFTs, DAOs, and entirely new ideas I have? Of course! Wait until you see whats next. <br>
[Available SDKs](/resources/sdks.md): rust, javascript, c#, python, go, java, swift, and many more!
